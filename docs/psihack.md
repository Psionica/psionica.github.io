## Overview

**PsiHack 2021** is the first online hackathon focused on building open source tools for cognitive augmentation. From non-linear note-taking apps to spaced repetition systems, the last years have witnessed an explosion of general tools for thought which amplify fundamental human capabilities in all sorts of clever ways. This new space brings together developers, cognitive scientists, designers, machine learning engineers, and educators in an ambitious project with strong transhumanist attitudes. **PsiHack 2021** aims to provide a casual context for tools for thought enthusiasts across the globe to get together, exchange ideas, and create working prototypes.
