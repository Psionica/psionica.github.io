## Overview

From personal knowledge management to spaced repetition, the past years have witnessed an explosion of tools which extend human thought in all sorts of clever ways. That said, the field as a whole is still in its infancy, with most work coming out of a loose network of start-ups, individual tinkerers, and a handful of research groups. Our very conception of what tools for thought are still appears underdeveloped and myopic to many (https://twitter.com/pvh/status/1388890170124947456). What's more, the wide range of approaches considered (e.g. networked thought, human-machine collaboration, immersive environments, brain-computer interfaces) makes it all the more difficult for new-comers to navigate this emergent field and for veterans to bridge transdisciplinary (and geographical) boundaries.

**PsiCon 2021** is the first unconference focused on designing and developing transformative tools for thought, seeking to provide a much needed forum for interdisciplinary discussion. It's an opportunity to explore recent trends in the field, exchange powerful ideas, and give rise to lasting collaborations. **PsiCon 2021** brings together developers, designers, researchers, engineers, and educators in an effort to pave the way towards transformative tools for thought.

"I want to be part of a rich scenius of serious, capable people doing full-time original research on enabling environments. I want to attend colloquia in which Iâ€™m regularly stunned by the ideas presented. I want peers who will candidly observe the limitations of my ideas, then work with me to improve them." - Andy Matuschak

Like any unconference, **PsiCon 2021** is participant-centric. Besides a few introductory lightning talks, the agenda is completely unknown prior to the actual event. Dynamic, yes, but not necessarily chaotic (in theory). Participants are free to host their own interactive sessions, which get scheduled towards the beginning of the umbrella event. A few ideas for sessions which you could host yourself include:
- a group discussion on challenges you're facing in designing tools for thought
- a quick demo of an open source tool for thought you've been working on in your organization
- a short talk introducing a relevant technology, followed by a discussion on possible use cases in the field
- a brainstorming session on how tools for thought could help in a specific type of knowledge work
- a quick chat on organizing events on the topic, hopefully with much better names

Given that the participants themselves are the central part of this experimental event, make sure to fill in a description and potentially a personal website when registering using an Open Collective account. This helps prospective participants get a sense of who's attending and helps you connect with other participants before, during, and after the unconference.
