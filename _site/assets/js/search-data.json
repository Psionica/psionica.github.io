    "content": "Just like there are sound frequencies we cannot hear and wavelengths of light we cannot see, there might very well be thoughts we cannot think.1 Being confined to a limited domain of thought is unsettling for many, especially considering our ideal of freedom of thought and the increasingly complex challenges we’re facing as a species. However, just like there are advanced sensors that can help us detect sound and light beyond our bodily senses, there are transformative tools that can help us think beyond what was previously thinkable.2 We can engineer “spacecraft” for venturing into the depths of conceptual space, exploring what lies beyond the pale blue dot of native human cognition.3 Artificial intelligence is especially well-positioned to fuel the expansion of our cognitive horizons through its remarkable skill of manipulating abstract representations.4 . What if you had a virtual assistant when navigating your thoughts? What if there was a Photoshop for editing concepts? What if you could radically edit your belief system on command? What if you could digest a textbook an order of magnitude faster? What if you could manipulate abstract representations with your body? Those are precisely the muddy, challenging, and daring questions we’re interested in. Our mission is to provide a “launchpad” for ambitious projects aiming to augment thought in transformative ways.

    "content": "Psionica’s structure is a project in itself. We’re suggesting a triple approach to cognitive augmentation in an attempt to surpass some of the challenges identified the field.5 By incorporating three nested constraints in our process, we’re trying to strike a balance between open-ended exploration through experimental prototypes and results-oriented development of software tools. Those layers are embedded in the Studio, the Lab, and the Workshop. |   | Studio | Lab | Workshop | . | This is the realm of the: | conceivable | feasible | practical | . | Typical projects include: | concept renders, design fictions, speculative works, future visions, vignettes, diegetic prototypes | experimental tools, proof of concepts, prototypes | software projects, production-ready tools, accessible utilities | . | This space is constrained by: | imagination | imagination, technical feasibility | imagination, technical feasibility, practical utility | . | Related paths include: | designers, futurists | makers, researchers, hackers | developers, engineers | . | It supports Psionica’s mission by: | inspiring people to envision radical tools for thought | shedding light on promising avenues in cognitive enhancement | directly building useful tools for thought | . It’s important to note that the three spaces aren’t by any means rigid departments. Rather, they’re simply mindsets which anyone can fluidly adopt as part of their work. Together, the three attitudes guide our foraging into cognitive augmentation in a manner any one mindset alone couldn’t, all while mutually informing each other. Besides being focused on creative output, Psionica is a self-sustained testing ground for newly developed tools for thought. Means of cognitive augmentation are being recursively applied to the process of developing means of cognitive augmentation. This insight-through-making loop is designed to exponentially expand the realms of what’s conceivable, feasible, and practical. There’s a slight overlap between Psionica’s structure and the futures cone model in futurism.6 The three spaces seem to provide a progressively narrower cone, from the possible to the probable. However, the futures cone is framed as a passive tool for contemplating possible technological trajectories, rather than as a prime instrument in actively guiding development. Psionica’s triple approach is geared towards impact by design. ",

One way to go about it might be to painstakingly read through an old textbook chapter on the topic, full of intimidating terminology and verbose notation.1 You might end up giving it a few solid reads, as building mental models from scratch is quite tedious. Now, picture yourself experimenting with an interactive animation on the same topic. You can now freely manipulate quaternions from the comfort of your desk while getting instant feedback across several parallel representations. Meanwhile, you’re being guided through the material in an accessible way, while systematically internalizing core concepts.2 . A broad range of methods have been developed through the years to guide the creation of engaging, insightful, and memorable educational resources. However, guidelines only go so far, and developers started building concrete tools to help creators in their process. For instance, one project aims to help authors make their online articles more memorable by easily embedding a custom spaced repetition system into the actual web page.3 Flashcards are knitted together with text and figures, making them an integral part of the article. This tool essentially turns otherwise static online essays into engaging and memorable artifacts.

There is indeed a growing collection of pixel-perfect explorable explanations and engaging learning experiences, but they pale in comparison to the rate at which mediocre static content is being published.6 It’s difficult enough for creators of educational resources to convey knowledge accurately and accessibly in the first place, and even more so with the additional hurdle introduced by complex creator-side tools. What if instead of focusing on building tools for creators, we focused on building tools for audiences to systematically get the best out of existing content? Building the shovels and pickaxes required to mine for educational gems, rather than investing in the alchemy of crafting the gems themselves. Think about how a committed student can easily turn a static lecture into flashcards, mind-maps, or sketchnotes in order to get the best out of the material. Could learner-side tools and practices radically extend beyond that with the help of technologies like AI? What if we could automatically turn the mountains of resources available in unfriendly formats into something more memorable, humane, and ergonomic?

    "content": "The most prevalent format employed by educational resources today is written text. Articles, essays, books, textbooks, and papers are all variations on the same tried and trusted way of conveying knowledge – writing. It only makes sense to focus our efforts on this particularly pervasive medium. Fortunately, text is also quite a machine-friendly format, as we’ve seen with MemNav. To explore the potential of AI in learner-side tools, we’ll attempt to use natural language processing to make text-based resources more brain-friendly. One especially popular way of making static text more cognitively ergonomic is to turn it into flashcards. Using flashcards for spaced repetition is standard practice for committed students across a wide range of disciplines, as it results in long-term information retention. It turns out that machines are surprisingly good at automatically creating flashcards from text-based content which is rich in information. By combining methods of question generation with methods of question answering, several language models can be configured to work in parallel, forming a system capable of generating flashcards based on arbitrary text. The task of answer-aware question generation, or what we’ll call flashcard generation, is based on the following steps being performed automatically by the system: . | Extract tentative answers for subsequently-generated questions. Those can be specific terms, entities, or short phrases which are likely to make good answers (e.g. “the junction rule”). | Based on the previously-extracted answers and the original text, try to generate related questions, as if playing Jeopardy (e.g. “What is another name for Kirchhoff’s current law?”). | Close the loop by checking whether the previously-generated questions actually match the previously-extracted answers using question answering. | . Equipped with this approach, we can start building Autocards, a flashcard generator based on existing open source tools. This time, we’re forking an excellent pipeline designed specifically for question generation.7 By encapsulating its functionality in a Python class capable of consuming various types of text (i.e. plain text, text files, PDF’s) we’re laying the groundwork for a large number of possible workflows. &gt;&gt;&gt; from autocards import Autocards &gt;&gt;&gt; a = Autocards() &gt;&gt;&gt; a.consume_text('King Philip’s ultimate goal was to conquer Persia.') . The resulting Python object can then be used to export flashcards derived from text as a CSV file which can later be imported in a wide range of spaced repetition apps. It provides a few handy options, such as adding a prefix to the front side of the flashcard and switching the questions up with the answers for a Jeopardy-style experience.8 . &gt;&gt;&gt; a.export('history.csv', prefix='HELLENISTIC AGE:', jeopardy=False) .

Each excerpt is followed by a set of automatically generated flashcards, pairs of questions and answers which have suffered no human modification whatsoever. Physics . “Kirchhoff’s junction rule says that the total current into a junction equals the total current out of the junction. This is a statement of conservation of charge. It is also sometimes called Kirchhoff’s first law, Kirchhoff’s current law, the junction rule, or the node rule. Junctions can’t store current, and current can’t just disappear into thin air because charge is conserved.

History . “King Philip’s ultimate goal was to conquer Persia and help himself to the empire’s land and riches. This was not to be; King Philip was assassinated by his bodyguard Pausanias in 336 B.C. at his daughter’s wedding, before he could enjoy the spoils of his victories. His son Alexander, known to history as “Alexander The Great,” jumped at the chance to take over his father’s imperial project. The new Macedonian king led his troops across the Hellespont into Asia. (When he got there, he plunged an enormous sarissa into the ground and declared the land “spear won.”) From there, Alexander and his armies kept moving.” . | Question | Answer | . | What was King Philip’s ultimate goal? | conquer Persia | . | Who was King Philip’s bodyguard? | Pausanias | . | Where was King Philip assassinated? | his daughter’s wedding | . | Who was King Philip’s son? | Alexander | . | Alexander led his troops across the Hellespont into what continent? | Asia | . | What did Alexander plunge into the ground when he got to Asia? | sarissa | . Biology . “DNA sequencing is a collection of scientific methods for determining the sequence of the nucleotide bases in a molecule of DNA. All living organisms have DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) in each of their cells. Each cell in an organism contains the genetic code for the entire organism. The process of DNA sequencing transforms the DNA from a given organism into a format that can be used by researchers for the basic study of biologic processes, medical research, and in forensics.” . | Question | Answer | . | What is a collection of scientific methods for determining the sequence of the nucleotide bases in a molecule of DNA? | DNA sequencing | . | What does DNA stand for? | deoxyribonucleic acid | . | What does each cell in an organism contain the genetic code for? | the entire organism | . | What is the use of DNA sequencing? | basic study of biologic processes, medical research, and in forensics | . Architecture . “The Villa Savoye at Poissy, designed by Le Corbusier in 1929, represents the culmination of a decade during which the architect worked to articulate the essence of modern architecture. Throughout the 1920s, via his writings and designs, Le Corbusier (formerly Charles-Edouard Jeanneret) considered the nature of modern life and architecture’s role in the new machine age.

A series of vignettes are provided below, each capturing the concrete routine of a hypothetical learner. This specific way of portraying otherwise exotic tools for thought was inspired by a seminal report on human augmentation.9 . The Scholar . Alice is a researcher in machine learning. The rate of new breakthroughs in the field these days is astonishing, and makes it difficult for even the most committed scholars to keep up with the pace of progress.10 This is not the case for Alice, though. As part of her morning routine, she launches Zotero, her open source reference manager, in order to have a look at a research paper she saved last week.11 While trying to get a high-level view of the paper, she starts highlighting relevant text directly in the PDF file using her document viewer. After a couple of passes through the paper, she triggers the automatic extraction of highlighted text from the PDF using Zotfile, her PDF management tool.12 Several days later, she copies all her annotations from that week and pastes them in a console running Autocards. After using it to generate batched flashcards, she polishes the CSV file and imports it in Anki, her open source spaced repetition system.13 . One of the few estimates I found on how much time an experienced researcher spends on creating flashcards based on a paper is listed below. From early hands-on experience with Autocards, this can reliably be brought down to around 5 minutes, after first reading it. “I typically spend 10 to 60 minutes Ankifying a paper, with the duration depending on my judgment of the value I’m getting from the paper.” – Michael Nielsen14 . The Bookworm . Bob is an avid reader. He’s aiming for reaching the 50 books per year mark, while still remembering the important bits later on.15 As part of his evening routine, he turns on his reMarkable tablet, a maker-friendly e-reader, and opens a non-fiction book.16 As he gets immersed in it, he highlights all sorts of insights, nuggets, and gems which resonate with him. After finishing the book several days later, he runs it through Biff, a tiny utility for extracting highlights made on the reMarkable tablet.17 He then pipes the extracted annotations through Autocards, polishes some of the flashcards in the CSV, and imports the file in Anki. He’s pretty sure he might have managed to implement the same workflow using the more popular Kindle e-reader, but he happens to be a big fan of the maker culture.18 . The Student . Charlie is a motivated student. He almost likes experimenting with study techniques more than actual studying, but he tries to strike a healthy balance regarding that. Throughout the day, he takes part in several lectures, some of which are online. During those, he tries to take concise notes which clearly capture important aspects of the material, while retaining the big-picture view. In order not to get caught up in making his notes look exceedingly aesthetic, he resorts to simply typing them out in Markdown, a light-weight markup language, using VS Code, an open source text editor.19 20 After the lecture, he goes through a k-probing session in order to better weave together what he just learned with his previous knowledge. While he’s busy reflecting on the material, Autocards is starting up and working through the notes, ultimately generating several dozen flashcards listed in a CSV, which Charlie polishes and imports in Anki. It’s tempting to quickly jump to rote memorization before actually understanding the material, and even more so with automated flashcard generation. Autocards is best used in tandem with techniques which foster understanding, such as the Feynman Technique or Knowledge Probes, as exemplified by Charlie. ",

    "content": "One of the main areas of improvement going forward is the quality of the questions generated by the system. They often come across as clunky and overly verbose, which might prove inconvenient for many. Fortunately, recent years have seen a steady rise in the performance of language models, which might soon become able to generate more natural questions.21 In the meantime, fine-tuning larger models on the task might help, as the current implementation is limited to the T5-small and T5-base models. Another clear area of improvement is a more user-friendly interface which would wrap around the core functionality. Unfortunately, the natural language processing component would translate to higher requirements for a client-side device, especially in terms of RAM and GPU. It might seem anticlimactic to heat up a GPU only to get a dozen lines of text in return, yet this is the price you currently have to pay for this sort of processing. Paid access to a hosted server might do, but it would be great to somehow make this powerful tool accessible. Additionally, the range of possible inputs which could be fed into Autocards might be extended. Various operating modes might instruct the system to, say, automatically extract the abstract, introduction, and discussion sections from a research paper for later use in flashcard generation. It could be adapted to consume a web article based on its URL by scraping the content and using it as input, perhaps after first piping it through an extractive summarization model. Autocards might even prove useful for generating flashcards for educational videos, by stripping the captions and using those as a starting point, or after crudely applying a speech-to-text pass. ",

    "title": "Introduction",
    "content": "In his visionary short story titled “Learning to Be Me,” Greg Egan describes the Ndoli Dual, a fictional brain implant which constantly monitors the host’s neural activity in an attempt to learn how it unfolds.1 After several years of collecting data, the Ndoli Dual becomes powerful enough to accurately forecast the neural activity of its host, prompting many to switch to it completely, outsourcing their entire thought process and achieving immortality. Besides describing a thought experiment which puts the Chinese room to shame in terms of vividness, Egan hints at an intriguing possibility – using a proxy for human thought as an optimization target for creating human-like artificial intelligence. An elegant formalism for thinking humanly, as per Russell and Norvig’s taxonomy.2 . “If the human race was replacing itself with clockwork automata, I was better off dead; I lacked the blind conviction to join the psychotic underground – who, in any case, were tolerated by the authorities only so long as they remained ineffectual. On the other hand, if all my fears were unfounded – if my sense of identity could survive the switch as easily as it had already survived such traumas as sleeping and waking, the constant death of brain cells, growth, experience, learning and forgetting – then I would gain not only eternal life, but an end to my doubts and my alienation.” – Greg Egan1 . However, even if neural activity seems to be the most accurate proxy for thought, accessible high-resolution neuroimaging techniques are a long way from being commercially viable. In order to implement Egan’s envisioned device, we need a proxy for thought which is cheap and abundant, so that our models have plenty of data to learn from. What we need is written language, the next best thing after neural activity in terms of capturing human thought processes. Infinitely expressive and highly economic, written language has been the preferred medium for capturing thoughts for centuries. Today, internet archives contain billions of them, from the most brilliant to the darkest. “You, I hope, are one of those explorers. You, I hope, found these sheets of copper and deciphered the words engraved on their surfaces. And whether or not your brain is impelled by the air that once impelled mine, through the act of reading my words, the patterns that form your thoughts become an imitation of the patterns that once formed mine. And in that way I live again, through you.” – Ted Chiang3 . This abundance, naturally, powered recent advances in natural language processing. That said, current language models typically reflect the aggregate thought patterns of millions of people who have contributed data to the training set, whether willingly or not. However, disciplined note-taking practices such as the Zettelkasten and digital gardening enable the fine-tuning of generic language models to one’s specific way of thinking. By using hundreds of written notes as training data, we can configure a model to learn to be the note-taker, to internalize their thought patterns, to adopt their writing style and interests, to approximate their mannerisms and responses. After several months of disciplined note-taking, the aligned model becomes powerful enough to accurately extrapolate the written thoughts of its user, enabling transformative new ways of conducting knowledge work and an early glimpse into immortality. We’ll now explore the inner workings of Dual, the piece of software which learns to be its user, named so as a tribute to Egan. However, before doing that, we’ll consider some useful framings for better understanding what your Dual is and what it isn’t. ",

    "content": "Your Dual is your second brain come to life . The ideas, concepts, and insights which you include in your second brain make up your Dual’s long-term memory in a manner reminiscent of the spreading activation model.4 Relevant pieces of knowledge are strategically remembered behind the scenes when your Dual is conversing with you, populating its working memory in a context-dependent manner. When finally engaging in a reply to your messages, the items stored in working memory are used in tandem with the previously fine-tuned language model to generate a response. The result is an expressive chatbot which seamlessly integrates disparate fragments of your knowledge into its replies. “And if one has to write anyway, it is useful to take advantage of this activity in order to create in the system of notes a competent partner of communication.” – Niklas Luhmann5 . Your Dual is a virtual assistant for thinking . Your Dual can’t make changes to your notes directly, it can only read from them when interacting with you. And that’s not a bug, it’s a feature. Your Dual is designed to assist you in knowledge work, rather than to do it for you. You still have to do the hard work of creating, linking, and updating notes. Why? Not because of technical obstacles, but rather because putting in the effort is helpful in the long-term: it fosters understanding and retention on a much deeper level.67 It would otherwise be extremely tempting to succumb to overreliance on this and future systems. Your Dual is there to amplify your impact through collaboration, not to replace you. It provides a metacognitive helping hand. “The best interface to my brain is a relationship. That’s how merging feels like. That’s how I envision it.” – George Hotz8 . Your Dual is the librarian of your thoughts . Your Dual is very apt at searching for items in your knowledge base, just like a librarian knows their way around the bookshelves. Ask it for notes which describe metaphors of the mind, and you’ll get a list of candidates in seconds, even if part of the search results were written years ago. Ask it for entries which provide arguments supporting the feasibility of mind upload, and it will readily point you towards the (numerous) relevant items. ",

Crucially, this language model is fine-tuned on your personal notes before use in order to accurately capture your way of thinking. The essence is the central component of your Dual and the only one of the three which differs from user to user. It’s here that your thought patterns are extracted and extrapolated. Skeleton . The skeleton consists of a collection of several smaller language models which play auxiliary roles in your Dual’s operation. Two text encoders are used sequentially to derive semantic embeddings from your notes which are then used when spontaneously remembering relevant knowledge. Yet another language model is tasked with determining which notes match a given natural language description when necessary. A local server exposes a minimal API for the interface to consume. Interface . The interface resembles an instant messaging chat, complete with a message history which you can scroll through, and even with a status indicator which signals whether your Dual is typing. This component (currently) consists of an Obsidian plugin which defines a new view in a side panel. Use the chat as you normally would, except that at the other end is your emulated self, rather than a peer. The interface is your main point of contact with your Dual. ",

Fluid and descriptive search are extractive features, meaning that they merely guide you to existing notes which are currently relevant. In contrast, open dialogue is a generative feature. It can be used to synthetize original content from scratch whose connection to previous notes is abstract and non-trivial. Naturally, this is the main attraction. Samples from the author’s own Dual are provided for illustration purposes.9 However, due to the underlying second brain being only several weeks old at the time of writing, a personal diary spanning several months has also been used for deriving the essence. Fluid Search . This search feature is all about what your notes are about. It goes beyond traditional search and can locate relevant notes regardless of whether they explicity contain the words used in the query, provided they’re about the same topic. In this, it’s fluid, it’s frictionless. | Find notes about seamlessly navigating one’s notes. | . By using fluid search through a collection of previous notes, one can elevate into their awareness the most semantically related items in their second brain. This way, they are then easily able to optimally weave together new information with old information, in the spirit of constructivism. Descriptive Search . This search feature builds on the previous one, but takes things a step further. You can now more flexibly describe the entries you are looking for, not only in terms of topic, but in terms of content. Find examples, arguments, parallels, and others. The possibilities are endless. | Look for a note which describes an analogy between machine learning and sociology. | . Contrastive learning is machine learning based on strategically sampling counterexamples for a given concept. Similarly, some sociologists argue that criminality and deviant behavior are essential for a well-functioning society as they provide “counterexamples” to the norm. Essentially, deviants successfully inform the social norm space, perhaps better than actual explicit norms. Their expressiveness is essential, as without them society would lose its sense of identity. There would be a collapse, just as in machine learning. | Search for a note which argues that measuring neural activity with EEG is tricky. | . In the brain-stadium metaphor, neural activity is associated with the vivid activity which happens inside a stadium during a sport event. Each individual supporter from the audience represents a neuron firing. According to this mapping, EEG corresponds to recording sound from outside the stadium, trying to reconstruct individual supporter activity. Additionally, single unit recording corresponds to having microphones down the throats of individual supporters. | Find a note which contains an application of VR. | . In virtual and augmented reality, abstract concepts can be grounded in concrete objects. For instance, in programming, a code library can become an actual physical library, a game tree can be an actual tree, calling a function can involve a phone. What’s more, virtual reality provides the necessary context for attempting to make any abstract concept tangible, in an effort to infuse them with embodied knowledge, forcing a host of cognitive functions to be applied to the same concept. Open Dialogue . As mentioned previously, open dialogue is the main dish. When you’re posing a question to your Dual, it automatically retrieves relevant notes and starts formulating a response based on them. The value of open dialogue lies not in retrieving cold facts from your knowledge base, but rather in tackling ambiguous open-ended questions. | How can we develop transformative tools for thought? 10 | . The second brain framework for cognitive augmentation provides a clear path to transhuman singularity through exponential self-improvement of the human individual and collective, in collaboration with AI. It’s also a pragmatic approach to cognitive enhancement, as it provides a pragmatic framework for dialogue between the two. The second brain framework for cognitive augmentation is very well-suited for the context of neuroplasticity, as it helps the user relax constraints and embrace radical new perspectives. This is in contrast to the more… . | What are some important questions in the neuroscience of attention? | . How does the brain create “tuning” in response to different stimuli? What are some features which distinguish attention? Are there “attention modalities”, or “attention channels”, or “attention frequencies”? How can the brain “see” different types of information from different perspectives? How can it compute a graph of information contents based on such topologies? Attention is often associated with sensations, movement, and attention alone. However, attention can also occur at the level of thought… . | How could one seamlessly edit their belief system on command? | . If one subscribes to the belief that truth is relative, then one can trivially “edit” their belief system as a document. They simply need to attach a semantic link to a statement which they believe is false, and then edit their text accordingly, with regards to the stated truth. This way, one’s belief system is merely an artifact which one has to reconcile with other beliefs in order to work effectively. Another way to reconcile conflicting beliefs is for the… . | Can ambiguity be used as a tool? | . In a sense, yes. However, in an arguably conflicting way. By using ambiguity as a means of promoting insight, one is also using it as a means of limiting creative output. The very act of intentionally distorting one’s perception of the world is often seen as an act of creation. This is a perspective often dismissed in the context of consciousness augmentation, but perhaps it’s not. Creativity can be seen as an intentional process of engineering the world in such a way as to support… . | Why should one learn in public? | . If one’s purpose is to develop a large body of knowledge, then one should actively seek out, learn from, and publish work. This would presumably lead to a positive feedback loop of more knowledge being gained, helping the individual maximize their contribution. However, the incentive for creation and creation of knowledge is also plagued by censorship, limiting the flow of knowledge. A good alternative is open access, enabling anyone to search through one’s work for useful insights. The creation of commonsense through machine learning… . ",

    "content": "Your Dual can naturally enable a wide variety of workflows as part of your knowledge work. An early selection is included below. Computer-Aided Incremental Reading . When learning about a new concept, an effective way to internalize it is to densely associate it with previous concepts. When creating a note, you can ask your Dual to look for previous related entries, aiding you in your weaving process. What’s more, the fuzzy nature of fluid search makes it so that even if you had absolutely no previous notes about the new topic, you can still find losely related notes which might be useful. Your Dual helps you optimally build on previous knowledge by minimizing semantic distances. Computer-Aided Incremental Writing . When revisiting previous notes, you might seek to integrate new perspectives, arguments, and applications in your entries. You can ask your Dual to look for examples, parallels, and evidence, and it will sift through thousands of your notes in several seconds, offering you the most relevant candidates. Using the search results, you can then thoughtfully integrate the notes you find suitable through dense linking. Computer-Aided Brainstorming . When tackling big questions or tough problems, throw your Dual into the mix as a brainstorming partner and wait for the surprising nuggets it inevitably comes up with. Even if it’s fine-tuned to approximate your way of thinking, its sampled responses are configured to be different every time, meaning that it’s virtually impossible for it to get stuck in a rut.

Extending the interface to work with Foam in VS Code is also a planned feature. Higher performance . All those language models take up a lot of memory and are somewhat sluggish.

    "content": "Take a moment to picture the following prototypical narrative. “Why is the sky blue?” the curious child asks. “Well, sunlight passes through the atmosphere before it gets here, which makes the sky appear blue,” answers the parent. At this point, both parties seem content with the exchange. Several moments later, the inevitable happens. “But why?” the child asks. Somewhat frustrated, the parent conveniently wraps up the conversation: “Because I said so.” . There are a couple of remarkable things to note about this narrative. First, the child manages to challenge the knowledge of the adult without possessing that knowledge herself. This is quite different from the situation in which a teacher is challenging the knowledge of a student. In this more formal setting, the teacher is very much aware of the established body of knowledge. In contrast, the very premise of the opening story is based on the ignorance of the curious child. It appears that we have a deeply-rooted drive to answer questions, which often requires us to draw on our own knowledge. This innate tendency is called instinctive elaboration, and it enables questions to force your brain into a relentless search for answers.1 . The second remarkable thing to note about this narrative is the simple nature of the questions. They are far from being elaborate descriptions of the requested information. Even a simple “Why?” would suffice in challenging the adult. Despite their minimal contents, the replies are effortlessly understood. The reason for that is that they are genuinely soaked in context, following the unwritten rules of pragmatics.2 The ongoing dialogue infuses each reply with meaning, enabling speakers to cut down on words without sacrificing the contents. This state of affairs makes it surprisingly easy to play the challenger, as many parents may be particularly aware of. ",

    "content": "Given how effective the child is in challenging the parent’s knowledge, could we promote critical thinking by embedding her behavior into a tool for thought? Could we incentivize people to actively reflect on their own beliefs by allowing them to converse with a “curious” machine? Even if the user wouldn’t actually receive new information in the exchange, the very act of highlighting gaps in their knowledge might be valuable. Such a tool could be used to challenge faulty beliefs, incentivize deeper understanding, and make assumptions salient. Those objectives are key to changing our relationship with hard questions into a healthier one. Annoying inquiries turn into opportunities for growth. This paradigm shift is fittingly captured by the concept of aporia. “Aporia is the feeling of realizing that what you thought was a path to truth actually doesn’t lead there at all. A shortcut to certainty has revealed itself to be an illusion. The first reaction to aporia might be frustration and even anger, but if you consider that it’s providing new information and could be saving you from wasting additional effort maintaining false certainty about an existing belief, it can flip into an Aha! moment that is even enjoyable.” – Buster Benson3 .

    "content": "After changing our perspective on hard questions, we can finally start building. Being inspired by the unreasonable effectiveness of the curious child, this tool will consist of nothing more than a set of questions and a basic method for sampling them. Difficult questions. Vague, muddy, demanding questions. Questions which genuinely get the person thinking. Revising, reframing, reviewing what they hold to be true. Questions which probe the otherwise obstructed depths of knowledge. Given their current purpose, we’ll also refer to these questions as knowledge probes, or k-probes for short. To integrate a minimal level of structure into the question set, we’ll use Bloom’s revised taxonomy as a starting point.4 This taxonomy is a widely used system for organizing learning outcomes across all levels of formal education, from kindergarten to university. These outcomes essentially capture the abilities which students are expected to possess by the end of a lesson, course, or programme. Formal education can be seen in part as a process of internalizing these abilities. The taxonomy consists of six broad categories, exemplified below with intended learning outcomes from the degree I’m currently pursuing. | Remember – Retrieve relevant knowledge. | Recall the high-level anatomy of the brain. | Recognize questionable research practices. | Know how to create reproducible workflows. | . | Understand – Construct meaning. | Explain the principles behind the general linear model. | Describe algorithms used for adversarial search. | Summarize the main approaches to speech synthesis. | . | Apply – Use knowledge in new situations. | Carry out a multivariate statistical analysis. | Implement a genetic algorithm. | Solve homogeneous differential equations. | . | Analyze – Determine how parts relate to a structure. | Investigate the relationship between syntax and semantics. | Analyze the interaction between various forms of memory. | Determine the relationship between subfields of cognitive science. | . | Evaluate – Make informed judgements. | Interpret the results of brain data analyses. | Determine the complexity of simple algorithms. | Evaluate set-theoretic statements. | . | Create – Reorganize elements into a structure. | Construct formal proofs for first-order logic. | Design a user interface based on cognitive ergonomics. | Develop models in a cognitive architecture. | . | . Due to the popularity of Bloom’s revised taxonomy, there are a lot of online resources containing examples of learning outcomes, complete with suggestions for classroom activities. After compiling examples from several such resources and rephrasing them as questions, I used a text generation service to extend the question set even further.5 Following several hours of co-creating questions with the machine, the total number of knowledge probes surpassed two hundred, a sample of which can be found below. | Remember – Retrieve relevant knowledge. | What are the basic facts of this? | What puzzle is this part of? | How would you characterize this? | . | Understand – Construct meaning. | How would you explain this to a peer? | What would be an analogy for this? | How would you represent this visually? | . | Apply – Use knowledge in new situations. | How can this be helpful? | Who can benefit from this? | How could this be applied to other domains? | . | Analyze – Determine how parts relate to a structure. | What’s the structure of this? | How do the components of this relate to each other? | How can this be viewed as a system? | . | Evaluate – Make informed judgements. | What assumptions underlie this? | What evidence supports this? | How would different people view this? | . | Create – Reorganize elements into a structure. | How can this be expanded? | How does this fit into a narrative? | How would you design something based on this? | . | . As in the case of the curious child, the value lies in the dialogue itself, rather than in the questions. Therefore, we need a method of stitching together questions with user replies, fostering an ongoing discussion. Fortunately, this method can be as simple as a chat-like textual interface which alternates between printing output questions and reading input replies. The unwritten rules of pragmatics will do the rest, helping the user instinctively turn the sequence of questions and replies into a meaningful dialogue by filling in the gaps. As a final layer of complexity, we’ll also use Bloom’s revised taxonomy as a basis for a more customizable experience. By specifying a numeric weight for each of the six categories, the user can adjust the probabilities of certain questions being asked. Larger weights will result in more questions being sampled from that category, relative to others. This way, the user can better tailor the tool to their current needs. Or, perhaps, to their intended “learning outcomes.” . ",

Computational semantics or natural language processing, depending on who you ask. | What is this a consequence of? | . They’re the result of exploiting word co-occurence information derived from large corpora. | How would you explain this to a teenager? | . Imagine you’re planning on traveling to a foreign country. The catch is, there’s no map available! You see, it’s quite an obscure country, perfect for a curious teen. The only thing available is a list of past itineraries – lists of cities which other travelers have visited before, in order. The interesting thing is that you can use those itineraries to sketch a map! Cities visited one after another should be near each other, right? You could try to come up with a map which matches the distance relations derived from the itineraries, and you’ll get a pretty accurate map you can use on your journey. In essence, language is like a set of itineraries, called sentences. However, instead of cities, it’s got words! I just took you along a journey through the country of language, traveling from one word to the next. It turns out that if you try to use the same reasoning here, you can actually pinpoint words on a map, based solely on a lot of text. Not a map of cities, mountains, and rivers, but a map of meaning. Semantic embeddings are the “geographical” coordinates of words in this country of language. | What issues can this help with? | . They can help machines extract meaning from otherwise plain text. | What other concepts are related to this? | . Text mining, natural language processing, vector semantics, lexical semantics. | How can this be a source for inspiration? | . If words can be represented as points in a space, what else could be represented this way? The effectiveness of semantic embeddings gets you thinking about what other things can be expressed like this. | Why is this relevant? | . It’s the most popular approach to extracting meaning from text. It drives most, if not all, of modern natural language processing efforts. | How do the components of this relate to each other? | . Each word is associated with a vector. All vectors inhabit the same space. There’s a relation between any two words, represented through the difference between their vectors. | What has to be in place before this can be applied? | . A lot of text for obtaining the embeddings, and a broader understanding of semantic embeddings in academia and industry. | What can this lead to? | . Machines which can reason about relatable concepts. Tools for thought as well. ",

Instinctive elaboration triggers an automatic drive for engaging with the knowledge probes. The conversational medium even makes the experience feel social. Despite the potential benefits of this approach, it’s also worth considering its downsides. The main disadvantage is the lack of rich feedback, which has otherwise been shown to be very effective in learning.6 However, one could argue that the increased ease of adapting the tool to new fields outweighs this shortcoming. Moreover, the self-supervised nature of this approach might still provide a feedback signal which is strong enough to be useful. We have a unique relationship with questions, so why not leverage that to our advantage? Knowledge probes are an early attempt of explicitly doing just that.

    "content": "Many of us routinely use search engines to navigate the internet. They help us find information so quickly and accurately that it’s hard to imagine browsing the internet without them. Their convenience even makes us perceive searchable information as less worthy of committing to memory.1 . Text mining is one of the core technologies behind search engines. By extracting meaning from text, search engines can easily match queries to appropriate pages. To get a sense of why language understanding is so important, imagine trying to find the details of preparing a meal in a cookbook written in a foreign language. Without text mining, search engines would similarly be limited to exact string matches, with no other means of navigating the rich body of knowledge they have at their disposal. Due in large part to its extensive business value, text mining is a relatively mature technology. From question answering to summarization, state-of-the-art solutions are proposed every few months.2 What if we could leverage this traction, and repurpose text mining in order to support powerful tools for thought? In the following sections, we’ll specifically explore the potential of this technology in navigating, and ultimately augmenting, human memory. ",

    "content": "In order to create tools capable of navigating memories, we first need to record them in a machine-readable format. One popular way of transcribing memories is journaling. By creating regular entries describing their daily thoughts, ambitions, and stories, people unknowingly build a genuine knowledge base of their lives. Slowly but surely, this accumulates into a comprehensive body of knowledge which spans months, years, or even decades.3 . Diaries mainly consist of text. As we’ve seen previously, machines are already fluent in text. This means that journaling is a very good candidate for supplying our future system with memories in a machine-readable format. In order to perform text mining, simply substitute web pages for diary entries, and let the algorithms do their job. “A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory. The lawyer has at his touch the associated opinions and decisions of his whole experience […] The physician, puzzled by a patient’s reactions, strikes the trail established in studying an earlier similar case […] The historian, with a vast chronological account of a people […]” – Vannevar Bush4 .

    "content": "Now that we have a way of converting memories into a machine-readable format, we can start implementing the actual features of the memory navigator, or MemNav for short. Illustrative samples from my own MemNav instance are provided for each command. The functionality of the system is encapsulated in a Python class which requires a root directory containing entries as text files. The source code builds on several open source modules, and is heavily inspired by the examples provided by their authors.5 6 . &gt;&gt;&gt; from memnav import MemNav &gt;&gt;&gt; mn = MemNav('../MorningPages') . Semantic Search . Internet search engines aren’t constrained to the exact words in your query. If a page refers to the same thing as your query, but with a slightly different wording, then the page is still likely to show up in the search results. MemNav uses similar techniques to help users retrieve information beyond a simple Find in text look-up. &gt;&gt;&gt; mn.search('embodied tools for thought') There was this announcement about a course on embodied critical thinking, which was at an intersection of philosophy, cognitive science, AI, and seems to be quite relevant for the tools for thought direction I chose recently. Yeah, actually I think I might apply. There's also a summer school in Iceland or something. &gt;&gt;&gt; mn.search('text mining memories') However, the propositional memory miner may change that, repurposing this whole thing, making it more valuable. Really curious to see whether that will result in anything useful or whether it will be just a witty hack of repurposing SOTA NLP models. &gt;&gt;&gt; mn.search('fMRI data processing') He suggested that we perform a deconvolution on the fMRI data in order to provide a better target for the model. But, what if we include the BOLD response convolution as the final step of the model and make it so that it has no learnable parameters. That's interesting because the deconvolution operation per se doesn't have a clear solution. Notice how the output of the second command contains none of the exact words present in the query. Finding all slight variations by hand would have been tedious. The summarization and semantic search samples might look similar. In reality, semantic search returns multiple results, one of which is included here as an illustration. Question Answering . When navigating the internet, you might often want a quick answer to a question, rather than a full-blown article on the subject. By systematically identifying relevant phrases in diary entries, MemNav can reliably answer questions about one’s previous thoughts, ideas, and experiences. &gt;&gt;&gt; mn.ask('Who did I spend the last day of 2020 with?') Bea &gt;&gt;&gt; mn.ask('Why would k-probes be useful?') To reflect on things I learned that day &gt;&gt;&gt; mn.ask('What does exosomatic mean?') Outside the body . Summarization . Maybe you’re not looking for an explicit detail, but you’re trying to get the general gist of a subject. By choosing a few sentences which together convey the most information, MemNav provides users with a condensed overview of what they’re interested in. &gt;&gt;&gt; mn.summarize('attention in humans and machines') What if the query, key, value metaphor used in transformers to attend to things and places was used in a cognitive architecture, building a cognitive model for attention. The transformer is based on a couple forms of attention, but how does that relate to attention in humans and animals? &gt;&gt;&gt; mn.summarize('dust theory') Egan is simply mindblowing. This idea of Dust Theory is deep, it's powerful. And the point is that this ever expanding computer being run in a cellular automaton would run based on dust. Based on patterns spread out across time and space. But this is not all! In the book they talk about such a representation. &gt;&gt;&gt; mn.summarize('grading assignments') It's mostly the gruntwork of grading and watching and attendance and so on. Not fulfilling at all. It's still only a part time job. But the part about grading homework isn't my favorite thing ever, it is the whole idea of selling time for money again. And I'm pretty sure homework can be redesigned so that it can be more efficiently graded, even automatically. ",

    "content": "It might be useful to go beyond the technicalities and reflect on the very identity of this project. By taking various perspectives on it, we can get a better sense of the interplay between tools for thought and existing technical frameworks. Search Engines . This is the view behind the opening paragraph. MemNav can intuitively be likened to a search engine. Instead of searching the internet, it searches memories. It achieves this by using diary entries as a proxy. If internet search engines already nudge us into neglecting searchable information, it might be important to investigate the psychological effects of using such mnemonic engines, bringing up debate on the line between voluntary usage and dependence. The fragility of human memory is actually useful in many ways. It supports all sorts of clever mental shortcuts. For example, the availability heuristic piggybacks on our forgetfulness and helps us quickly gauge the frequency of an event. By simply using the ease of remembering a few occurences as a proxy, it side-steps the need of actually considering all event instances. It turns out that many of our mental quirks are better described as double-edged swords, rather than down-right flaws.7 Simply making away with them might lead to unintended consequences. Additionally, if internet search engines already grant varying degrees of exposure to items based on financial contributions, then what would happen if third-party memory systems would also follow financial incentives? Which memories would be more profitable, and therefore more likely to be remembered? Such daunting prospects further support the need for humane values being embedded in technology. Expert Systems . Early AI research had a strong focus on expert systems. Take the expertise of a doctor, embed it into propositional statements and inference rules, and you get a system which can give diagnostics with decent accuracy. Do the same with the expertise of a judge, and you get a system capable of giving rudimentary verdicts in court. MemNav can also be seen as an expert system. It’s not an expert in medicine or law, but an expert in you. An expert in your thought process. You first embed your expertise in it, and then work with it. How does it feel to outsource such highly personal knowledge to a machine? How does it feel to interact with an expert in your thought process other than yourself? Would you allow it to freely interact with others on your behalf, as a matter of convenience? Granting my significant other experimental access to my MemNav already feels peculiar. Outsourcing more mental faculties to machines and integrating more third-party components into our thinking will force us to ask such questions increasingly often. Exosomatic Memory . When your computer runs low on storage, you might move a few files to an external drive or to the cloud. What happens when your memory is overloaded with tasks, events, plans, ideas, and so on? You might offload that burden onto convenient task managers, calendars, planners, notebooks, and so on. Those can be collectively refered to as exosomatic memory systems (i.e. memory systems located outside the body). MemNav can also be considered an instance of such a system. However, when you happen to expand the storage capacity of your device, say by upgrading your local storage or by purchasing cloud storage, more often than not you stop being cautious about your memory usage. A constrained memory system might force you to focus on the right things, in a way a set of storage buckets replicated across multiple server farms might not. Another thing to consider is the changing relation between memory acquisition and retrieval. The way we learn things strongly influences the way we remember them. For instance, knitting together a tight network of associations has been shown to foster subsequent retrieval.8 However, if memories are stored in a machine-readable format, then they may be subjected to a wide range of programmatic transformations. Attach definitions to terms. Break text blocks into atomic interconnected items. Form new links in the semantic network. Those possibilities might pave the way for new educational practices. The Mind’s API . When a piece of software exposes an API, it offers an interface to third-party software as a means of programmatically interacting with it. MemNav can also be seen as an API. It offers programmatic access to your memories, enabling an entire suite of tools to integrate with it. This API is currently read-only, as it only offers indirect access to your thought process through the text artifacts. Your actual memory is separated from MemNav as a result of the one-way process of creating the artifacts. However, the artifacts being processed may get closer to their authors over time, eventually leading to authors identifying with them. ",

    "content": "Despite its promising performance, MemNav has several shortcomings which currently limit its potential in augmenting memory. First, it runs slow enough to feel unnatural as an extension of your memory. With a large corpus, it usually takes several solid seconds for results to be provided, depending on the task. However, clear trends in decreasing compute costs might solve this problem in the long run. “In order to function as exosomatic memory, information retrieval systems must be so good so that retrieving information is like remembering.” – Gregory Newby9 . Second, creating the knowledge base which underlies MemNav takes time. It requires a sustained regular commitment, and may become tedious. However, future methods will likely enable more efficient ways of recording memories. Using a speech-to-text service would easily triple the rate of transcribed words per minute. Wearable and handheld devices already bring in a multimedia dimension to the endeavor. Neural interfaces might obviate the need for words entirely. Finally, there’s a more nuanced issue. The linear structure of a diary might be a very poor representation of the non-linear structure of thought. The programmatic transformations mentioned previously may be crucial in better aligning the cognitive space with the information space.10 High-dimensional representations similar to the ones used by Semantica might be a much better fit for the task. Despite its current flaws, MemNav manages to provide an insightful vantage point on the nature and impact of future tools for thought. The reflections it supports are as valuable as the functions it enables, as it helps us paint a picture of our desired technological path. ",

    "content": "Mental models are simplified descriptions of the world around us. For instance, one of them might describe networks. A forest is a network of trees. A society is a network of people. A brain is a network of neurons. Mental models help us make sense of the world by allowing us to apply previous knowledge to new situations. They are widely seen as powerful tools for thought, especially when they come in large numbers. If one’s repository of mental models is vast, then they’ll be able to approach new situations from many different perspectives. This is the motivation behind many recent efforts of compiling extensive lists of them.1 . “Our systematic cross-realm translations are the roots of fruitful metaphors; they enable us to understand things we’ve never seen before. When something seems entirely new in one of our description-worlds, it may turn out that when translated to some other world it resembles something we already know.” – Marvin Minsky2 . “Metaphors allow us to understand one domain of experience in terms of another. This suggests that understanding takes place in terms of entire domains of experience and not in terms of isolated concepts.” – George Lakoff &amp; Mark Johnson3 . ",

    "content": "However, mental models are only one side of what can be more broadly described as conceptual thinking. In this view, mental models are just sets of systematic relations between concepts. The previous network model merely captures the relation between a forest and a tree, between a society and a person, and between a brain and a neuron. Having said that, there is so much more to concepts than mental models. You can connect them to similar ones. You can mix them together into new ones. You can transform them in meaningful ways. You can explore the nuances between them. What if we could build tools which enabled us to work with concepts in a similar way Photoshop enables us to work with images? What if we could build tools which extend our conceptual thinking beyond what is humanly possible? Instead of blending colors, we would combine concepts. Instead of creating gradients, we would explore continua of meaning. Instead of defining intricate visual patterns, we would define systematic patterns of meaning. “In this it resembles a program such as Photoshop or a spreadsheet or 3D graphics programs. Each provides a novel set of interface primitives, primitives which can be internalized by the user as fundamental new elements in their thinking.” – Shan Carter &amp; Michael Nielsen4 . “Human intellectual effectiveness can be affected by the particular means used by individuals for their external symbol manipulation.

    "content": "However, tools like Photoshop don’t directly work with colors, gradients, or patterns. At the lowest level, editing photos boils down to manipulating matrices of numbers. In order to build powerful tools for conceptual thinking, we might need an analogous way to fix concepts into firm numerical foundations which we could then easily manipulate. Fortunately, there already are ways of doing that. The field of natural language processing has long used semantic embeddings as the numerical substrate of discrete concepts.6 Among others, they’re used in search engines to understand queries, in chatbots to understand conversations, and in translation systems to understand foreign languages. Think of semantic embeddings as numeric coordinates. They don’t describe locations in a physical space, like geographic coordinates, but locations in a space of meanings, a semantic space.7 . An intuitive understanding of how semantic embeddings are obtained is beyond the scope of this article, but what is relevant for our current purposes can be captured in a few neat properties exhibited by the semantic space: . | Conceptual differences correspond to geometric distances. | Conceptual parallelism corresponds to geometric parallelism. | . But analytic geometry is no reason for despair, because as graphic designers don’t need to be knowledgeable about convolutions and tensors when using Photoshop, the tools for thought which we set out to build will be usable regardless of the user’s proficiency in maths. We’ll use semantic embeddings only as a low-level foundation for higher-level tools which enable anyone to work with concepts in exciting ways. That’s where we’ll go next. In the following sections, we’ll define and use new tools for thought built on top of semantic embeddings, and in doing so incrementally grow Semantica, a veritable computational toolkit for conceptual thinking. “But let the human specify to the instrument his particular conceptual need of the moment, relative to this internal image. Without disrupting its own internal reference structure in the slightest, the computer will effectively stretch, bend, fold, extract, and cut as it may need in order to assemble an internal substructure […] it portrays to the human via its display a symbol structure designed for his quick and accurate perception and comprehension of the conceptual matter […]” – Douglas Engelbart5 .
