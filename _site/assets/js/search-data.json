    "content": "An open collective on a mission to augment thought for all. Learn More Join Us . Just like there are sound frequencies we cannot hear and wavelengths of light we cannot see, there might very well be thoughts we cannot think.1 Being confined to a limited domain of thought is unsettling for many, especially considering our ideal of freedom of thought and the increasingly complex challenges we’re facing as a species. However, just like there are advanced sensors that can help us detect sound and light beyond our bodily senses, there are transformative tools that can help us think beyond what was previously thinkable.2 We can engineer “spacecraft” for venturing into the depths of conceptual space, exploring what lies beyond the pale blue dot of native human cognition.3 Artificial intelligence is especially well-positioned to fuel the expansion of our cognitive horizons through its remarkable skill of manipulating abstract representations.4 . What if you had a virtual assistant when navigating your thoughts? What if there was a Photoshop for editing concepts? What if you could radically edit your belief system on command? What if you could learn at a rate of decades per week? What if you could manipulate abstract representations with your body? Our mission is to provide a launchpad for ambitious projects aiming to augment thought in such transformative ways. We achieve this through: . | Hosting a thoughtware discovery hub which helps connect knowledge workers with the creative artifacts of thoughtware engineers. | Organizing online events which connect thoughtware engineers with knowledge workers in order to exchange ideas and best practices. | Moderating a Discord server and Reddit sub for providing casual spaces for chatting about thoughtware. | .

It achieves this by using Street View panoramas as support for associating abstract ideas with concrete places which the user is familiar with. The process of using Memory Maps involves breaking down a line of reasoning, a train of thought into an outline of discrete steps. The outline is then linked to a journey across a real route along a real neighborhood. The paths are then traversed based on a spaced repetition schedule, one location after another, assisted by the panoramas.
