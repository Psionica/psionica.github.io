    "content": "Just like there are sound frequencies we cannot hear and wavelengths of light we cannot see, there are thoughts we cannot think.1 However, just like intricate sensors help us detect sound and light beyond our senses, there are transformative tools which enable us to think beyond what was previously thinkable.2 Our mission is to develop and leverage such tools for thought by exploring the intersection between artificial intelligence and cognitive science. In our work, we’re routinely addressing questions such as: . | What if you had a search engine for your own memory? | What if there was a Photoshop for editing concepts? | What if a chatbot helped you challenge your assumptions? | What if you could radically edit your belief system on command? | What if you could instantly make a textbook easier to digest? | .

    "content": "Psionica’s organizational structure is a project in itself. We’re suggesting a triple approach to cognitive augmentation in an attempt to surpass some of the challenges identified the field. By incorporating three nested constraints in our process, we try to strike a balance between open-ended exploration through experimental prototypes and results-oriented development of software tools. Those layers are embedded in the studio, the lab, and the workshop. |   | Studio | Lab | Workshop | . | This is the realm of the: | conceivable | feasible | practical | . | Typical projects include: | concept renders, design fictions, speculative works, future visions, vignettes, and diegetic prototypes | experimental tools, proof of concepts, and prototypes | software projects, production-ready tools, and accessible utilities | . | This space is constrained by: | imagination | imagination, technical feasibility | imagination, technical feasibility, practical utility | . | Related paths include: | designers, futurists | makers, researchers, tinkerers | developers, engineers | . | It supports Psionica’s mission by: | inspiring people to envision radical tools for thought | shedding light on promising avenues in cognitive augmentation | directly building useful tools for thought | . | Mindset qualities include: | open-minded, free thinking, creative | curious, inquisitive, exploratory | results-oriented, pragmatic | . It’s important to note that the three spaces aren’t by any means rigid departments. Rather, they’re simply mindsets which anyone can fluidly adopt as part of their work. Together, the three attitudes guide our foraging into cognitive augmentation in a manner any one mindset alone couldn’t, all while mutually informing each other. ",
