Imagine you’re trying to grasp the essence of quaternions, a somewhat esoteric mathematical construct. One way to go about it might be to painstakingly read through an old textbook chapter on the topic, full of intimidating terminology and verbose notation.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> You might end up giving it a few solid reads, as building mental models from scratch is quite tedious. Now, picture yourself experimenting with an interactive animation on the same topic. You can now freely manipulate quaternions from the comfort of your desk while getting instant feedback across several parallel representations. Meanwhile, you’re being guided through the material in an accessible way, while systematically internalizing core concepts.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p><p>A broad range of methods have been developed through the years to guide the creation of engaging, insightful, and memorable educational resources. However, guidelines only go so far, and developers started building concrete tools to help creators in their process. For instance, one project aims to help authors make their online articles more memorable by easily embedding a custom spaced repetition system into the actual web page.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> Flashcards are knitted together with text and figures, making them an integral part of the article. This tool essentially turns otherwise static online essays into engaging and memorable artifacts. Yet other tools help creators bring abstract concepts to life through programmatically-generated videos and interactive animations. <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p><h2 id="empowering-audiences"> <a href="#empowering-audiences" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="empowering-audiences"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Empowering Audiences</h2><p>However, few creators possess the skill, interest, and know-how required to create such cognitively ergonomic content. There is indeed a growing collection of pixel-perfect explorable explanations and engaging learning experiences, but they pale in comparison to the rate at which mediocre static content is being published.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> It’s difficult enough for creators of educational resources to convey knowledge accurately and accessibly in the first place, and even more so with the additional hurdle introduced by complex creator-side tools.</p><p>What if instead of focusing on building tools for creators, we focused on building tools for <em>audiences</em> to systematically get the best out of existing content? Building the shovels and pickaxes required to mine for educational gems, rather than investing in the alchemy of crafting the gems themselves. Think about how a committed student can easily turn a static lecture into flashcards, mind-maps, or sketchnotes in order to get the best out of the material. Could learner-side tools and practices radically extend beyond that with the help of technologies like AI? What if we could automatically turn the mountains of resources available in unfriendly formats into something more memorable, humane, and ergonomic? We’ll attempt to answer this exact question with a working prototype.</p><hr /><h2 id="design"> <a href="#design" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="design"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Design</h2><p>The most prevalent format employed by educational resources today is written text. Articles, essays, books, textbooks, and papers are all variations on the same tried and trusted way of conveying knowledge – writing. It only makes sense to focus our efforts on this particularly pervasive medium. Fortunately, text is also quite a machine-friendly format, as we’ve seen with <a href="/tools/memnav">MemNav</a>. To explore the potential of AI in learner-side tools, we’ll attempt to use natural language processing to make text-based resources more brain-friendly.</p><p>One especially popular way of making static text more cognitively ergonomic is to turn it into flashcards. Using flashcards for spaced repetition is standard practice for committed students across a wide range of disciplines, as it results in long-term information retention. It turns out that machines are surprisingly good at automatically creating flashcards from text-based content which is rich in information. By combining methods of question generation with methods of question answering, several language models can be configured to work in parallel, forming a system capable of generating flashcards based on arbitrary text. The task of answer-aware question generation, or what we’ll call flashcard generation, is based on the following steps being performed automatically by the system:</p><ol><li>Extract tentative answers for subsequently-generated questions. Those can be specific terms, entities, or short phrases which are likely to make good answers (e.g. “the junction rule”).<li>Based on the previously-extracted answers and the original text, try to generate related questions, as if playing Jeopardy (e.g. “What is another name for Kirchhoff’s current law?”).<li>Close the loop by checking whether the previously-generated questions actually match the previously-extracted answers using question answering.</ol><p>Equipped with this approach, we can start building Autocards, a flashcard generator based on existing open source tools. This time, we’re forking an excellent pipeline designed specifically for question generation.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> By encapsulating its functionality in a Python class capable of consuming various types of text (i.e. plain text, text files, PDF’s) we’re laying the groundwork for a large number of possible workflows.</p><div class="language-plaintext code-block highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from autocards import Autocards
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Autocards()
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.consume_text('King Philip’s ultimate goal was to conquer Persia.')
</code></pre></div></div><p>The resulting Python object can then be used to export flashcards derived from text as a CSV file which can later be imported in a wide range of spaced repetition apps. It provides a few handy options, such as adding a prefix to the front side of the flashcard and switching the questions up with the answers for a Jeopardy-style experience.<sup id="fnref:22" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p><div class="language-plaintext code-block highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a.export('history.csv', prefix='HELLENISTIC AGE:', jeopardy=False)

As part of her morning routine, she launches Zotero, her open source reference manager, in order to have a look at a research paper she saved last week.<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">11</a></sup> While trying to get a high-level view of the paper, she starts highlighting relevant text directly in the PDF file using her document viewer.

He almost likes experimenting with study techniques more than actual studying, but he tries to strike a healthy balance regarding that. Throughout the day, he takes part in several lectures, some of which are online. During those, he tries to take concise notes which clearly capture important aspects of the material, while retaining the big-picture view. In order not to get caught up in making his notes look exceedingly aesthetic, he resorts to simply typing them out in Markdown, a light-weight markup language, using VS Code, an open source text editor.<sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">19</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">20</a></sup> After the lecture, he goes through a <a href="/tools/k-probes">k-probing</a> session in order to better weave together what he just learned with his previous knowledge.

Autocards is best used in tandem with techniques which foster understanding, such as the Feynman Technique or Knowledge Probes, as exemplified by Charlie.</p><hr /><h2 id="future-steps"> <a href="#future-steps" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="future-steps"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Future Steps</h2><p>One of the main areas of improvement going forward is the quality of the questions generated by the system. They often come across as clunky and overly verbose, which might prove inconvenient for many. Fortunately, recent years have seen a steady rise in the performance of language models, which might soon become able to generate more natural questions.<sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">21</a></sup> In the meantime, fine-tuning larger models on the task might help, as the current implementation is limited to the T5-small and T5-base models.</p><p>Another clear area of improvement is a more user-friendly interface which would wrap around the core functionality. Unfortunately, the natural language processing component would translate to higher requirements for a client-side device, especially in terms of RAM and GPU. It might seem anticlimactic to heat up a GPU only to get a dozen lines of text in return, yet this is the price you currently have to pay for this sort of processing. Paid access to a hosted server might do, but it would be great to somehow make this powerful tool accessible.</p><p>Additionally, the range of possible inputs which could be fed into Autocards might be extended. Various operating modes might instruct the system to, say, automatically extract the abstract, introduction, and discussion sections from a research paper for later use in flashcard generation. It could be adapted to consume a web article based on its URL by scraping the content and using it as input, perhaps after first piping it through an extractive summarization model. Autocards might even prove useful for generating flashcards for educational videos, by stripping the captions and using those as a starting point, or after crudely applying a speech-to-text pass.</p><hr /><h2 id="acknowledgements"> <a href="#acknowledgements" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="acknowledgements"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Acknowledgements</h2><p>Our work is supported by awesome people: <a href="https://opencollective.com/adam-wiggins">Adam Wiggins</a>, <a href="https://opencollective.com/alex-hubert-iwaniuk">Alex Iwaniuk</a>, <a href="https://stuhlmueller.org/">Andreas Stuhlmüller</a>, <a href="https://opencollective.com/bruno-winck">Bruno Winck</a>, <a href="https://opencollective.com/chris-boette">Chris Boette</a>, <a href="https://opencollective.com/david-d">David Dohan</a>, <a href="https://opencollective.com/flancia">Flancia</a>, <a href="https://opencollective.com/i-do-recall-inc">I Do Recall, Inc.</a>, <a href="https://opencollective.com/nickmilo">Nick Milo</a>, <a href="https://opencollective.com/maggie-appleton">Maggie Appleton</a>, <a href="https://opencollective.com/serjhunt_ark">Serj Hunt</a>, <a href="https://opencollective.com/yangwao">Yang Wao</a>.</p><h2 id="support-us"> <a href="#support-us" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="support-us"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Support Us</h2><p>Our only stakeholder is humanity.
