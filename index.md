## Mission

Just like there are sound frequencies we cannot hear and wavelengths of light we cannot see, there might very well be thoughts we cannot think.[^1] Being confined to a limited domain of thought is unsettling for many, especially considering our ideal of freedom of thought and the ever more complex challenges we're facing as a species.

However, just like advanced sensors can help us detect sound and light beyond our bodily senses, there are transformative tools which can help us think beyond what was previously thinkable.[^2] We can engineer "spacecraft" for venturing into the depths of conceptual space, exploring what lies beyond the pale blue dot of native human cognition.[^3] Artificial intelligence is especially well-positioned to fuel the expansion of our cognitive horizons through its remarkable skill of manipulating abstract representations.[^5]

What if you had a virtual assistant when navigating your thoughts? What if there was a Photoshop for editing concepts? What if you could radically edit your belief system on command? What if you could digest a textbook an order of magnitude faster? What if you could manipulate abstract representations with your body? Those are precisely the muddy, challenging, and daring questions we're interested in.

Our mission is to provide a "launchpad" for ambitious projects aiming to augment thought in transformative ways.

Ready for takeoff.

## Structure

Psionica's structure is a project in itself. We're suggesting a triple approach to cognitive augmentation in an attempt to surpass some of the challenges identified the field.[^4] By incorporating three nested constraints in our process, we're trying to strike a balance between open-ended exploration through experimental prototypes and results-oriented development of software tools. Those layers are embedded in the Studio, the Lab, and the Workshop.

|  | Studio | Lab | Workshop |
|-|-|-|-|
| **This is the realm of the:** | conceivable | feasible | practical |
| **Typical projects include:** | concept renders, design fictions, speculative works, future visions, vignettes, diegetic prototypes | experimental tools, proof of concepts, prototypes | software projects, production-ready tools, accessible utilities |
| **This space is constrained by:** | imagination | imagination, technical feasibility | imagination, technical feasibility, practical utility |
| **Related paths include:** | designers, futurists | makers, researchers, hackers | developers, engineers |
| **It supports Psionica's mission by:** | inspiring people to envision radical tools for thought | shedding light on promising avenues in cognitive augmentation | directly building useful tools for thought |

It's important to note that the three spaces aren't by any means rigid departments. Rather, they're simply *mindsets* which anyone can fluidly adopt as part of their work. Together, the three attitudes guide our foraging into cognitive augmentation in a manner any one mindset alone couldn't, all while mutually informing each other.

There's a slight overlap between Psionica's structure and the futures cone model in futurism.[^6] The three spaces seem to provide a progressively narrower cone, from the possible to the probable. However, the futures cone is framed as a passive tool for contemplating possible technological trajectories, rather than as a prime instrument in actively guiding development. Psionica's triple approach is geared towards impact by design.

## Support Us

Our only stakeholder is humanity. Help us keep it that way.

By supporting our efforts, you're investing in transparent research and development at the frontier of thought. Not only are you helping us deliver open source tools reshaping the landscape of knowledge work, but you're also setting in motion a broader movement around cognitive augmentation as a second-order consequence.
