## Mission

Just like there are sound frequencies we cannot hear and wavelengths of light we cannot see, there are thoughts we cannot think.[^1] However, just like intricate sensors help us detect sound and light beyond our senses, there are transformative tools which enable us to think beyond what was previously thinkable.[^2] Our mission is to develop and leverage such tools for thought by exploring the intersection between artificial intelligence and cognitive science.

In our work, we're routinely addressing questions such as: 
- What if you had a search engine for your own memory?
- What if there was a Photoshop for editing concepts?
- What if a chatbot helped you challenge your assumptions?
- What if you could radically edit your belief system on command?
- What if you could instantly make a textbook easier to digest?

## Structure

Psionica's organizational structure is a project in itself. We're suggesting a triple approach to cognitive augmentation in an attempt to surpass some of the challenges identified the field. By incorporating three nested constraints in our process, we try to strike a balance between open-ended exploration through experimental prototypes and results-oriented development of software tools. Those layers are embedded in the studio, the lab, and the workshop.

|  | Studio | Lab | Workshop |
|-|-|-|-|
| **This is the realm of the:** | conceivable | feasible | practical |
| **Typical projects include:** | concept renders, design fictions, speculative works, future visions, vignettes, and diegetic prototypes | experimental tools, proof of concepts, and prototypes | software projects, production-ready tools, and accessible utilities |
| **This space is constrained by:** | imagination | imagination, technical feasibility | imagination, technical feasibility, practical utility |
| **Related paths include:** | designers, futurists | makers, researchers, tinkerers | developers, engineers |
| **It supports Psionica's mission by:** | inspiring people to envision radical tools for thought | shedding light on promising avenues in cognitive augmentation | directly building useful tools for thought |
| **Mindset qualities include:** | open-minded, free thinking, creative | curious, inquisitive, exploratory | results-oriented, pragmatic |

It's important to note that the three spaces aren't by any means rigid departments. Rather, they're simply *mindsets* which anyone can fluidly adopt as part of their work. Together, the three attitudes guide our foraging into cognitive augmentation in a manner any one mindset alone couldn't, all while mutually informing each other.
