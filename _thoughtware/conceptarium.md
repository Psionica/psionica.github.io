description: A Google Drive for thoughts, enabling users to easily store, relate, and surface their ideas. Unlike the Zettelkasten family, this tool automates the entire book-keeping process using AI, so that you can focus on the knowledge work. It supports both language and imagery, can be accessed from both desktop and mobile, and can easily integrate with third-party tools.
mechanics: copy-recall-paste, dynamic linking of notes, serendipity as search parameter.
