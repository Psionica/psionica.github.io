description: Napkin is an easy system to collect and reflect thoughts. Its network structure reveals connections you couldn't see in a classic list and folder structure. The interface is optimized for flow and inspiration and built around a directed graph instead of a classic file tree. Each thought becomes a node in a dynamic network and can convey more information than its mere content through either manually or automatically defined relationships to other thoughts.
mechanics: live surfacing of past thoughts while editing a new entry.
