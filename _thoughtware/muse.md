description: Muse is a spatial canvas for your research notes, reading, sketches, screenshots, and bookmarks. Because deep thinking doesn’t happen in front of a computer. Pull in relevant information , then arrange as you see fit. Muse lets you sift and sort through it all, helping you find new patterns and insights. Sketching in Muse isn‘t restricted to a dedicated space. Ink on top of, next to, or between things. Type a sentence, then scribble a note over it. The unique zooming interface lets you rely on your brain‘s spatial memory to switch contexts without ever getting lost.
mechanics: spatially nested canvases.
