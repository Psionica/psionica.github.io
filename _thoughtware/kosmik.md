description: The Kosmik Universe is your infinite, digital playground to put objects together, manipulate the objects and the relationships they share with each other, as you let the many become one until the One emerges out of the play. It is akin to a whiteboard transformed by all things digital, all things web-native, all things Internet. Such a new paradigm introduces a whole new set of creation flows and in our explorations, weâ€™ve already seen some unprecedented possibilities.
mechanics: spatial hyperlinks, drag and drop links onto canvas as page objects, transclusion on a canvas.
