description: Patera is an environment for teams to think, plan, and model scenarios in, allowing you to throw out the boring, endless sheets of paper and present dynamic documents. By using excel syntax you can explore possibilities, outcomes and alternatives. Like a spreadsheet you can actually read.
mechanics: spreadsheet rendered as natural language, linked spreadsheet cells as editable text labels.
