description: Memory Maps is a digital tool for learning which aims to make using the method of loci (i.e. memory palace) seamless and intuitive. It achieves this by using Street View panoramas as support for associating abstract ideas with concrete places the user is familiar with. The process of using Memory Maps involves breaking down a line of reasoning, a train of thought into an outline of discrete steps. The outline is then linked to a journey across a real route along a real neighborhood. The paths are then traversed based on a spaced repetition schedule, one location after another, assisted by the panoramas. 
mechanics: Street View panoramas as support for method of loci, learning by turning outlines into journeys.
